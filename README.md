MyFirstLongPoll
==============

MyFirstLongPoll Sample App for AerCloud. You can use this app with the AerCloud 
[Get Started Guide](https://aeriscom.jira.com/wiki/display/DOCS/Getting+Started).
The difference between this app and the [MyFirstTracker](https://github.com/aercloud/MyFirstTracker) 
app is that you can use long-polling to continuously receive live data feed from 
your device.
 
Use the App with Your AerCloud Account
